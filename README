ICMP based libpcap backdoor based on the idea from: http://packetstormsecurity.org/search/?q=silentdoor

Also includes the ability to send shellcode for execution and a connectionless shell functionality

To build, you only need to have libpcap development files installed.
Then you should only have to run make.
To make a debug build with error message run: make debug
If you have upx installed and would liked a packed version: make upx
